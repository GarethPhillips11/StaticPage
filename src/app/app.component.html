          The system will allow for ERP to
          better manage the project by
          providing an online interface to
          interact with the project data and
          manage the assigning and
          maintenance of the bicycles. It also
          provides ERP with a more concrete
          method of tracking the students
          progress through RFID technology.

          #Bikes4ERP is a ERP project that
          distribute bicycles to students in
          remote rural areas. So that students
          who live far away are able to attend
          classes more frequently allowing
          them to focus on their education.
          Then after a 2 year period if they
          have performed well academically
          the student is allowed to keep the
          bicycle forever.
